AmiDock version 1.3 - 03/10/91 by Gary Knight

  AmiDock will provide you with a number of buttons on the WorkBench screen
that when pressed will launch other programs. These buttons are fully
configurable to run any program you want with a single press.

Here a a brief run down of the features of AmiDock:

AmiDock can run programs that need a CLI or the WorkBench.

AmiDock uses IFF brushes for the button imagery. The brushes used are
  standard IFF files and can be customized to your individual wants and
  desires. In fact many of the programs you will add to the dock will need a
  brush created for them. I have included a Dock Image Grid for this
  purpose, but more about that later.

AmiDock is compatible with WorkBench 1.2, 1.3, and 2.0 and will run on
  any Amiga computer with any amount of memory. AmiDock has been tested
  on all Amiga machines (500/1000/2000/2500/3000).
